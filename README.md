About: This project represents a professional website primarily running
off Bootstrap5. Bootstrap was chosen due to the beneficial responsiveness
it provides. SVG icons were also used throughout the project courtesy of 
Bootstrap. 

A favicon image was generated to use for the tab icon. However, this is not
showing up outside of being locally hosted. 

Javascript was used to grab input from the contact form section, and alert the user of their input.
